The User is fully responsible and liable for all actions the User performs using the Service.<br/>                            3.6. Planq Dev does not warrant any results, including but not limited with regard to any profits or<br/>                            losses on purchasing and/or holding Tokens, or that Tokens will have any particular value or<br/>                            any monetary value at all.<br/>                            3.7. The User is fully responsible for meeting the technical and functional requirements and using<br/>                            the electronic communication facilities that are necessary to be able to access and use (parts<br/>                            of) the Service. The risk of loss, theft or damage to any information and/or assets, including<br/>                            but not limited to Tokens, will at all times be borne by the User.<br/>                            3.8. The User indemnifies Planq Dev and holds Planq Dev harmless against any and all claims (of<br/>                            third parties) relating to or resulting from a breach of Section 3.4 and. 3.7.<br/>                            4. Service<br/>                            4.1. Planq Dev hereby grants the User, under the suspensive (in Dutch: opschortende) and<br/>                            rescinding (in Dutch: ontbindende) conditions of these Terms, the right to use the Service<br/>                            under the conditions of these Terms.<br/>                            4.2. Planq Dev shall make good faith efforts (in Dutch: inspanningen te goeder trouw) to allow<br/>                            the User to use the Service.<br/>                            4.3. The User agrees that the Service is provided on an as is and as available basis. Planq Dev<br/>                            does not warrant that the Service will be error-free, complete or up-to-date at all times.<br/>                            Planq Dev does not guarantee that the Service or any part thereof will be accessible at all<br/>                            times and without any interruptions or failures. Failures in the Service can occur as a result of<br/>                            failures in the internet, on Blockchains, the Planq Blockchain, and/or as a result of viruses<br/>                            and/or faults and/or defects.<br/>                            4.4. In order to be able to use the Service, the User needs to connect and/or import its Wallet to<br/>                            the Service.<br/>                            4.5. The Service is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Planq<br/>                            Dev may make changes to such Features and specifications, all of which may mean that the<br/>                            Service no longer meets Users initial expectations. User agrees to that.<br/>                            4.6. The Service may fail to secure the critical involvement and cooperation of key participants.<br/>                            Planq Dev and/or the Service may face competition from other entities that have more capital<br/>                            or resources and offer a wider range of products and services that may outperform the<br/>                            Service. Planq Dev and/or the Service may be subject to actions by private parties regarding<br/>                            Intellectual Property Rights and other contractual matters. (International) laws, regulations<br/>                            and/or rules applicable to technology industries, including but not limited to those relating to<br/>                            blockchain technology, may affect or limit the design, implementation and operation of the<br/>                            Service.<br/>                            5. Pricing<br/>                            5.1. Use of the Service is in principle free of charge, without prejudice to the provisions of this<br/>                            Section.<br/>                            5.2. The risk and expense for using the (adequate) resources for the use of the Service, such as a<br/>                            mobile phone, internet connection, electricity, Wallet, and the security thereof, et cetera, is<br/>                            borne by the User.<br/>                            5.3. Tokens are in principle not free of charge, unless they are lawfully earned by User by staking<br/>                            PLQ, by running a Planq Blockchain validator and/or by providing liquidity. Tokens can be<br/>                            purchased respectively obtained to the extent there is an offer for such. Separate conditions<br/>                            may apply to such an offer. Planq Dev may not be a party to such an agreement. In that<br/>                            event, the User acknowledges and accepts that Planq Dev is not liable for any actions of<br/>                            such a third party.<br/>                            5.4. The User may have to pay Gas Fees to make use of several Features of the Service. User<br/>                            agrees that paying Gas Fees are subject to fluctuating (price) changes and that paying Gas<br/>                            Fees will be solely for the Users expense.<br/>                            5.5. The Service itself comprises open-source or source-available self-executing Planq Smart<br/>                            Contracts and/or Smart Contracts that are or may be deployed on various public Blockchains,<br/>                            such as the Planq Blockchain. By using the Service the User understands that Planq Dev<br/>                            does not control execution of the smart contracts and/or does not control any Blockchain.<br/>                            When the User pays Gas Fees, those fees accrue to (PLQ) stakers, liquidity providers and/or<br/>                            validators on the specific Blockchain. Separate conditions may apply between the User and<br/>                            the concerning third party. Planq Dev is not a party to that agreement. User acknowledges<br/>                            and accepts that Planq Dev is not liable for any actions of such a third party.<br/>                            6. Third parties<br/>                            6.1. Planq Dev has no knowledge of and/or involvement in the actions or information carried out<br/>                            or made available by Users via the Service. If another User or a third party reports to Planq<br/>                            Dev unlawful actions or information through use of the Service, and makes this plausible,<br/>                            Planq Dev will restrict, remove or otherwise make inaccessible the actions or information in<br/>                            question according to the notice-and-takedown principle known in the industry. User<br/>                            acknowledges and accepts that Planq Dev is not liable for restricting, removing or otherwise<br/>                            making inaccessible the relevant acts or information.<br/>                            6.2. Planq Dev expressly has no involvement in the contact made between Users and/or between<br/>                            User and third parties as a result of the Service nor in any agreements and/or contracts,<br/>                            resulting from this contact. Planq Dev is not a party to any agreement between Users and/or<br/>                            User and third parties, unless otherwise agreed.<br/>                            6.3. The Service may contain links to other applications, Blockchains, platforms, services or<br/>                            websites that are not managed by Planq Dev. Planq Dev has no control or authority over<br/>                            them, makes no warranties or representations in relation thereto and accepts no<br/>                            responsibility therefor or for any loss or damage that may arise from their use. The use of<br/>                            these applications, Blockchains, platforms, services or websites of third parties may be<br/>                            subject to terms of use or terms of service of the relevant third party. Planq Dev is not a party<br/>                            thereto.<br/>                            7. Blockchain specific risks<br/>                            7.1. By accessing and using the Service, the User represents that it is financially and technically<br/>                            competent enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and<br/>                            blockchain-based systems, and that it has a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies<br/>                            of IBC, EVM, and digital assets such as PLQ, Binance Coin (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), so-called<br/>                            stablecoins such USD Coin (USDC), EVM-compatible Tokens, IBC-compatible Tokens, and<br/>                            other digital Tokens, including but not limited to those following Ethereum Token Standards,<br/>                            such as the ERC-20 standard.<br/>                            7.2. The User understands that the markets for these digital assets are nascent and highly<br/>                            volatile due to risk factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology,<br/>                            security, and regulation. The User understands that anyone can create a Token, including<br/>                            fake versions of existing Tokens and Tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and<br/>                            acknowledge and accept the risk that the User may mistakenly trade those or other Tokens.<br/>                            So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or<br/>                            adequately collateralised, and may be subject to panics and runs.<br/>                            7.3. The User understands that (smart contract) transactions automatically execute and settle,<br/>                            and that Blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed. The User<br/>                            acknowledges and accepts that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and<br/>                            Blockchain-based systems such as the Planq Blockchain are variable and may increase<br/>                            dramatically at any time. The User further acknowledges and accepts the risk of selecting to<br/>                            trade in so-called expert-modes, which can expose the User to potentially significant price<br/>                            slippage and higher costs.<br/>                            7.4. Blockchains can be subject to periodic congestion where transactions can be delayed or lost.<br/>                            Individuals may also intentionally spam Blockchains in an attempt to gain advantage in using<br/>                            the Service. The User acknowledges and understands that a Blockchain may not record the<br/>                            Users transaction when the User wishes, or may not record the Users transaction at all.<br/>                            7.5. The source code underlying the (components of) the Service, Tokens, Token Bridge and/or the<br/>                            (Planq) Blockchain may contain errors, bugs, defects or inconsistencies that could jeopardise<br/>                            the predictability, usability, functionality, stability and security. Planq Dev makes no warranty<br/>                            that any errors will be identified or that the source code will be error-free. If User observes<br/>                            such an error, the Users sole and exclusive remedy is to report this to Planq Dev. Planq Dev<br/>                            may, at its sole discretion, replace the parts that contain an error or create a workaround.<br/>                            7.6. In addition, changes or updates to the aforementioned source code or Blockchains may lead<br/>                            to unexpected or unintended results that could adversely affect the utility or functionality of<br/>                            the Service or related services. Changes in source code that constitute upgrades may be<br/>                            necessary in connection with the development of the Service or related services, and Users<br/>                            failure to participate in such upgrades may result in the loss of some or all of the Services<br/>                            functionality.<br/>                            7.7. Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to disrupt the Service, or<br/>                            related services, in various ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks,<br/>                            denial-of-service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfs and spoofing. In<br/>                            addition, because Blockchains and/or the Planq Blockchain, Token Bridge and the Service are<br/>                            based on open source software, there is a risk that (Planq) Blockchain (smart contracts) may<br/>                            contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses that could negatively affect Service<br/>                            or result in the loss of the Tokens of the User, the loss of the User's ability to access or control<br/>                            the User's Tokens. In the event of such software error or weakness, there may be no remedy<br/>                            and the User cannot be guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.<br/>                            7.8. Tokens obtained by the User may be held by the User in the User's Wallet, which requires a<br/>                            private key or combination of private keys for access. Accordingly, the loss of the required<br/>                            private key(s) associated with the User's Wallet or Wallet in which Tokens are stored will<br/>                            result in the loss of such Tokens, access to the User's balance and/or any initial balances in<br/>                            Blockchains created by third parties. In addition, any third party who gains access to such<br/>                            private key(s), including by accessing credentials of a hosted Wallet that the User uses, may<br/>                            misuse the User's Tokens. Planq Dev is not responsible for such losses.<br/>                            7.9. It is the User's responsibility to ensure that the address of the Wallet provided to Planq Dev<br/>                            and/or third parties and/or connected to the Service can accept all types and categories of<br/>                            Tokens, including but not limited to Planq Blockchain compliant tokens. Planq Dev is not<br/>                            responsible if the Wallet provided by the User cannot accept Tokens distributed by Planq Dev,<br/>                            the Service and/or third parties. The User assumes all responsibility with respect to the<br/>                            foregoing and Planq Dev shall not be liable for the foregoing.<br/>                            7.10. The Service and the matters set forth in the documents, including but not limited to the Planq<br/>                            Documentation and other documentation sharing platforms, are new and untested. The<br/>                            Service may not be completed, implemented or (fully) executed. Even if the Service is<br/>                            completed, implemented or executed, it may not function as intended, and any Tokens<br/>                            associated with it may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Technology<br/>                            changes quickly and the Service and Tokens can become obsolete.<br/>                            8. Token Bridge<br/>                            8.1. When the User uses the Token Bridge Transaction Fees may be charged for each transaction<br/>                            executed via the Token Bridge.<br/>                            8.2. The aforementioned Transaction Fees may be modified by Planq Dev, in its sole discretion,<br/>                            and will be payable in either the source Token or the destination Token at the discretion of<br/>                            Planq Dev.<br/>                            8.3. The Transaction Fee for a specific transaction will be displayed to the User of the Token<br/>                            Bridge during the initiation of a transaction and must be accepted by the User before<br/>                            executing such a transaction. The User hereby consents to such fees being debited from<br/>                            either a combination of both of their source Token or destination Token at the time the<br/>                            transaction is processed.<br/>                            9. Intellectual Property Rights<br/>                            9.1. Planq Dev and/or its suppliers reserve all rights not expressly granted to the User in these<br/>                            Terms.<br/>                            9.2. The User acknowledges and agrees that, except as specifically set forth in these Terms,<br/>                            Planq Dev and/or its suppliers retain all rights, title and interest, including the Intellectual<br/>                            Property Rights, in and to the Service as well as any modifications, adaptations or<br/>                            translations thereof. The User acknowledges and agrees that he/she does not acquire any<br/>                            rights therein, express or implied, except for the rights expressly granted under these Terms.<br/>                            9.3. The User is not permitted to sell, rent out, transfer, or grant restrictive rights to the Service or<br/>                            to make it available to third parties in any way or for any purpose. The User will also refrain<br/>                            from granting third parties access, remotely or otherwise, to the Service and/or information or<br/>                            to provide the Service and/or information to a third party.<br/>                            9.4. The User is explicitly not allowed to download, reverse-engineer, copy, amend, or provide<br/>                            otherwise (parts of) the Service, other materials made available to the User by means of the<br/>                            Service, for direct or indirect commercial purposes or for any other purposes than the<br/>                            purposes mentioned in these Terms, unless Planq Dev has provided its prior written consent<br/>                            thereto, or if a mandatory or peremptory rule of law states otherwise.<br/>                            9.5. The User is also not allowed to make a back-up copy of the Service.<br/>                            9.6. To the extent that open source software forms part of the Service, the licensing conditions of<br/>                            the relevant open source software may apply.<br/>                            9.7. To the extent that third party software forms part of the Service, the licence terms of the<br/>                            relevant third party shall apply. The user can obtain such licence terms from the relevant<br/>                            parties.<br/>                            10. Privacy<br/>                            10.1. During the use of the Service, the User may provide Personal Data to Planq Dev. If so, these<br/>                            Personal Data will be saved and processed in accordance with Planq Devs Privacy Policy,<br/>                            and the applicable legislation with regard to the protection of Personal Data.<br/>                            11. Maintenance<br/>                            11.1. Planq Dev is entitled to put the Service (temporarily) out of service and/or to reduce the use of<br/>                            it without any prior notification and without being obliged to pay any compensation<br/>                            whatsoever to the User, if in the opinion of Planq Dev this is necessary, for instance in<br/>                            connection with the reasonably required maintenance of the Service or due to force majeure<br/>                            (in Dutch: overmacht). Force majeure includes, but is not limited to, unavailability of a<br/>                            Blockchain, consequences of Blockchain specific risks, site or building blockades, strikes, riots,<br/>                            civil disruption, war, terrorist acts, inclement weather, epidemics, pandemics, specific work<br/>                            interruptions, delay in transportation, earthquake, fire, storm, flood, or water damage, delay<br/>                            in or cancellation of the delivery to Planq Dev of parts, goods or services ordered from third<br/>                            parties, or Governmental restrictions.<br/>                            12. Liability<br/>                            12.1. Planq Dev shall not be responsible or liable to the User for any loss and assume no<br/>                            responsibility for, and shall not be liable to the User for any use of the Service, including but<br/>                            not limited to any loss, damage or claim arising out of: (i) user error, for example if the User<br/>                            forgets his password(s), incorrect transactions or mistyped addresses; (ii) server failure or<br/>                            data loss; (iii) corrupted (Wallet) files; (iv) loss of Tokens.<br/>                            12.2. Planq Devs liability for attributable failing (in Dutch: toerekenbare tekortkoming) in the<br/>                            performance of these Terms and/or the Agreement, or any other wrongful act (in Dutch:<br/>                            onrechtmatige daad) or otherwise, is excluded, insofar permitted by mandatory law.<br/>                            12.3. If Planq Dev is liable to the User for damage under mandatory law, Planq Devs liability is<br/>                            limited to compensation for direct damage. Under no circumstances will Planq Devs total<br/>                            liability for direct damage, on whatever legal basis, exceed EUR 1,000,- (thousand euros).<br/>                            12.4. Direct damage is exclusively understood to mean:<br/>                            12.4.1. material damage to property;<br/>                            12.4.2. reasonable costs incurred to prevent or limit direct damage that could be expected<br/>                            as a result of the event on which the liability is based; and<br/>                            12.4.3. reasonable costs incurred to determine the cause of the damage.<br/>                            12.5. Liability of Planq Dev for indirect damage (in Dutch: indirecte schade) is excluded. Indirect<br/>                            damage is understood to mean all damage not expressly designated as direct damage in the<br/>                            previous paragraph, including but not limited to consequential damage (in Dutch: indirecte<br/>                            schade, gevolgschade), lost profits, lost savings, losses with regard to Token prices, Token<br/>                            Bridge losses, exchange rate losses, or any other financial loss, reduced goodwill, damage<br/>                            due to business interruption, damage due to materials or software of third parties and<br/>                            damage due to mutilation, destruction or loss of data and/or documents.<br/>                            12.6. The exclusions and limitations referred to in the previous paragraphs of this Section do not<br/>                            apply if and insofar as the damage is the result of intent or gross negligence on the part of<br/>                            Planq Dev or its management.<br/>                            12.7. Unless compliance by Planq Dev is permanently impossible, Planq Dev is only liable for<br/>                            attributable failures (in Dutch: toerekenbare tekortkomingen) if the User gives Planq Dev<br/>                            notice of default (in Dutch: ingebrekestelling) without delay, whereby a reasonable period is<br/>                            set for remedying the shortcoming, and Planq Dev also after that period has attributably<br/>                            failed in the fulfilment of its obligations. The notice of default must contain a complete and<br/>                            detailed description of the failures, so that Planq Dev is given the opportunity to respond<br/>                            adequately.<br/>                            12.8. A condition for the exercise of any right of the User with regard to compensation is always<br/>                            that the User reports the damage to Planq Dev in writing as soon as possible, but at the<br/>                            latest within thirty (30) days after the damage has arisen.<br/>                            12.9. Any claim for compensation against Planq Dev lapses by the mere lapse of three (3) months<br/>                            after the claim arose, unless the User has instituted a legal claim for compensation before the<br/>                            expiry of that period. This does not affect the User's obligation to complain.<br/>                            12.10. The User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Planq Dev harmless from any and all<br/>                            third-party claim or damages (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with or<br/>                            resulting from the use that the User makes of the Service, a violation by the User of these<br/>                            Terms and/or the Agreement, and/or any unlawful activities, including but not limited to the<br/>                            breach of User warrants (Section 3), Intellectual Property Rights (Section 9), and/or privacy<br/>                            rights of Planq Dev and/or third parties.<br/>                            13. Term and termination<br/>                            13.1. Any use of the Service under these Terms and/or the Agreement is entered into for an<br/>                            indefinite period.<br/>                            13.2. In addition to the other remedies available to Planq Dev, Planq Dev is at all times, at its sole<br/>                            discretion, or if it deems such necessary, without prior written notice or explanation and<br/>                            without becoming liable to the User, entitled (but not always obliged) to:<br/>                            13.2.1. take all reasonable measures in order to avert dangers regarding the Service,<br/>                            Planq Dev and/or third parties;<br/>                            13.2.2. take all reasonable measures in order to stop and/or mitigate (the effects of) a<br/>                            breach as described in Section 3.4;<br/>                            13.2.3. recover the damages caused by a breach, as described in Section 3.4, from the<br/>                            User;<br/>                            13.2.4. freezing of assets (in Dutch: het bevriezen of van tegoeden) within the Service,<br/>                            including but not limited to Tokens, granted to the User;<br/>                            13.2.5. reversing of benefits (in Dutch: het terugdraaien van voordelen), including but<br/>                            limited to carrying out corrective transactions;<br/>                            13.2.6. restrict, modify, adapt, (temporarily) take the Service out of use, restrict its use,<br/>                            and/or terminate it. If the User does not agree with the adjustments and/or<br/>                            changes made, their only option is to stop using the Service;<br/>                            13.2.7. suspend (in Dutch: opschorten) or terminate (in Dutch: be�indigen) (temporarily<br/>                            or permanently) the right to access and use the Service and/or use of the Tokens<br/>                            by means of the Service or to ban a User from the Service, in the event that Planq<br/>                            Dev, at its sole discretion and without becoming liable for compensation of<br/>                            damages, deems such termination necessary. This includes, without limitation, the<br/>                            Users alleged use of bots, scripts, (automated) software, due to changes in taxes,<br/>                            security, corporate or other (Governmental) laws, or if Planq Dev determines in its<br/>                            sole discretion that the Tokens constitutes a security or other form of financial<br/>                            instrument subject to regulation by a Governmental authority, the situation where<br/>                            the User does not (in time), in full or properly meet its obligations and/or<br/>                            warranties, or where the User fails to comply with these Terms and/or the<br/>                            Agreement;<br/>                            13.2.8. (temporarily) restrict the Users activities in connection with the Service and/or<br/>                            Tokens and/or to ban a User from the Service.<br/>                            13.3. Planq Dev shall not be liable for any loss of Tokens or (other) assets suffered as a result of<br/>                            any action as mentioned in Section 13.2.<br/>                            13.4. Planq Dev is authorised to rescind (in Dutch: ontbinden) the Agreement due to an<br/>                            attributable failure in the performance of the Agreement and/or these Terms if the User,<br/>                            without a notice of default being necessary, is attributable failing to fulfil its obligations under<br/>                            the Agreement and/or these Terms.<br/>                            13.5. All provisions which are meant to survive the termination of the Agreement shall survive such<br/>                            termination.<br/>                            13.6. Upon termination or rescission, in any way whatsoever, of the use of the Service under these<br/>                            Terms, the Users right to access the Service and use the Token(s) shall cease to exist<br/>                            immediately, without any right to compensation whatsoever.<br/>                            14. Applicable law and dispute resolution<br/>                            14.1. These Terms are exclusively governed under the laws of The Netherlands. Unless mandatory<br/>                            law provides otherwise, the laws of The Netherlands apply exclusively to the Agreement, the<br/>                            Terms and the Service. The Vienna Sales Convention does not apply.<br/>                            14.2. The User and Planq Dev will work together in good faith to resolve any dispute. If the Parties<br/>                            are unable to resolve a Dispute within ninety (90) days after all Parties have received written<br/>                            notice of such dispute, such dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration as defined in<br/>                            Sections 14.3 and 14.4 below.<br/>                            14.3. Any dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the<br/>                            Stichting Geschillenoplossing Automatisering (SGOA) in effect at the time of the arbitration.<br/>                            The number of arbitrators is one (1), chosen by Planq Dev. The seat, or legal place, of<br/>                            arbitration is The Hague (in Dutch: Den Haag). The language of instruction in the<br/>                            arbitration proceedings is Dutch. All documents to be supplied are in Dutch.<br/>                            14.4. If the User is a consumer, or if a provisional or conservatory injunction is required, the User<br/>                            may initiate legal proceedings before the competent court. The competent court is the District<br/>                            Court in the District of Limburg, location Maastricht, the Netherlands, unless mandatory law<br/>                            stipulates otherwise.<br/>                            15. Miscellaneous<br/>                            15.1. The User will not assign or otherwise transfer any of his/her rights and obligations under<br/>                            these Terms, without our prior written consent, but Planq Dev may assign or transfer these<br/>                            Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this<br/>                            Section will be void. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding upon, and inure to<br/>                            the benefit of, the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.<br/>                            15.2. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the User and Planq Dev for your use of<br/>                            the Services.<br/>                            15.3. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,<br/>                            ineffective or unenforceable for any reason, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to amend<br/>                            these Terms to best achieve the Parties' original intent, in an acceptable manner so that the<br/>                            transactions contemplated hereby are carried out as fully as possible as originally<br/>                            contemplated.<br/>                            15.4. Planq Dev reserves the right to amend these Terms at any time. The User will be notified of<br/>                            any amendments by way of notification on the Platform and/or in the Service. The new<br/>                            version of the Terms will be available for viewing and downloading on the Platform and/or on<br/>                            the Website. If the User continues to use the Service after these Terms have been amended<br/>                            or supplemented, the User thereby irrevocably accepts the amended or supplemented Terms.<br/>                            If the User does not agree with the amended or supplemented Terms, Users exclusive<br/>                            remedy is to no longer use the Service and to directly terminate the Agreement.<br/>                            15.5. The legal status of cryptographic Tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear<br/>                            or uncertain in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how and if Governmental authorities<br/>                            will regulate such technologies. It is also difficult to predict how and if a Governmental<br/>                            authority could make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that affect, amongst<br/>                            others but not limited to, Planq Dev, the (Planq) Blockchain, the Website, the Platform, the<br/>                            Token Bridge, Tokens, and the Service. Such changes can negatively affect the Service in<br/>                            several ways, for example by establishing that Tokens are regulated financial instruments<br/>                            that require registration. Planq Dev may suspend the Service, development of the Service or<br/>                            operations in any jurisdiction in the event that Governmental action makes it illegal or<br/>                            commercially undesirable to continue.<br/>                            15.6. The industry in which Planq Dev operates is new and may be subject to increased<br/>                            surveillance and control, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no<br/>                            assurance that Governmental authorities will not investigate Planq Devs activities and/or<br/>                            take enforcement action against Planq Dev. Such activities by Governmental authorities may<br/>                            or may not be the result of targeting Planq Dev in particular. All of this could subject Planq<br/>                            Dev to convictions, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Planq Dev to restructure its<br/>                            operations and operations or discontinue offering certain products or services, all of which<br/>                            could damage Planq Devs reputation or lead to increased operational costs, which in turn<br/>                            have a material adverse effect on the Service and/or the development of the Service. The<br/>                            User acknowledges and accepts these options.<br/>                            15.7. The User agrees and acknowledges that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other<br/>                            communications provided by Planq Dev to the User under these Terms and/or in connection<br/>                            with the Users use of the Service shall be made Planq Dev in its sole discretion and may be<br/>                            provided to the User in electronic form at its discretion.<br/>                            ***
